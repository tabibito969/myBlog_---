 大家好，我是赵浩宇，我来自山东临沂，其实我高中学的是日语，所以其实我的英语并不好

 让我先介绍一下这个网站吧

 这是我自己搭建的个人博客，搭建这个网站的契机是 openlab，现在正好拿来用了，网址我放到最后了，如果大家有兴趣可以之后自己点开看看，有可能我也会尝试更新这个网站，这是我的几个账号，bilibili，GitHub，QQ和微信。

 这是几张装饰用的图片，这是小说「文学少女」，这是漫画「狂战士」，然后这两个是游戏，然后这下面是几本书，其实也是为了装饰随便放的，这些地方的小作文是我练习的时候写的，甚至有的地方还用了中文拼音，然后这下面是歌曲，我喜欢听歌，尽管我唱歌不好听。如果你点击它，它就会播放，甚至你可以同时播放 6 首歌曲，但这里我就先不放了。
 
 接下来让我给大家介绍一下我的家乡临沂

 这是新琅琊，这是临沂市博物馆，这两张是我去玩的时候拍的，这是临沭的朱村，大家有来玩过吗，我老家在临沭，但不在朱村，甚至于我是有一堂美术课老师放纪录片我才知道朱村的。

 然后是家乡的美食，这是临沂炒鸡，但我并不知道它为什么是家乡的代表菜，我觉得更有代表性的应该是这个，煎饼，糁什么的。

 ok 我的自我介绍就到这里，谢谢大家

Hi everyone, I'm Zhao Haoyu. I'm from Linyi, Shandong. I studied Japanese in high school, so my English isn't very good.

Ok，Let me **introduce** this website first.

This is a personal blog I built myself. I started it because of OpenLab, and now it's **perfect** to use here. I'll put the URL at the end—feel free to check it out later if you're interested. I might try updating it sometimes too. These are my **accounts**: Bilibili, GitHub, QQ and WeChat.

These are some **decorative** pictures. This is the novel "Bungaku Shoujo", this is the comic "Berserker", and these two are games. **Below** are a few books—I just put them there for **decoration**. The short writings here are practice pieces I did; some even have Pinyin,Yes zhongwenpinyin.Then there are songs down here. I love listening to music, even though I'm not good at singing. If you click on them, they'll play—you can even play 6 songs at the same time, but I won't demo that now.

Next, let me tell you about my hometown, Linyi.

This is New Langya, and this is Linyi Museum—I took these two photos when I visited. This is Zhucun Village in Linshu. Has anyone been here? My hometown is in Linshu, but not in Zhucun. I didn't even know about Zhucun until my art teacher showed a **documentary** in class.

Then there's the local food. This is Linyi Stir-Fried Chicken, but I don't know why it's the **representative** dish of my hometown. I think more iconic ones are pancakes, sha  and things like that.

Okay, that's my self-introduction. Thank you all!
